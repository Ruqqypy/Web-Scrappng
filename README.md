This Python script is designed to perform web scraping for collecting stock prices and revenue data for specific companies (e.g., Tesla). It utilizes various Python libraries to request, parse, and process data from web pages.

# Libraries Used:
1. **requests**: To fetch HTML content from web pages.
2. **beautifulsoup4**: To parse and navigate the HTML content of web pages.
3. **html5lib**: Used as a parser with BeautifulSoup to handle HTML content.
4. **pandas**: To manipulate and analyze the scraped data in a tabular format.

# Key Functionality:
- The script starts by importing the necessary libraries.
- It defines functions to fetch stock and revenue data by scraping specific web pages.
- The `get_stock_data` function retrieves stock price information for a given company.
- The `get_revenue_data` function scrapes revenue data from another webpage.
- Data is stored in pandas DataFrames, which allows for easy manipulation and analysis.

# How It Works:
1. **Fetch Stock Data**: The script makes an HTTP request to a web page containing stock price information using the `requests` library. The HTML content is parsed with BeautifulSoup, and relevant data points (like dates and stock prices) are extracted and stored in a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Fetch Revenue Data**: Similarly, the script fetches and parses revenue data from another webpage. This data is also stored in a pandas DataFrame for further processing.

3. **Data Cleaning and Processing**: The script processes the data by converting date columns to datetime objects using pandas, ensuring that comparisons and filtering operations can be performed correctly.

# Limitations:
- The graphing functionality intended to visualize the scraped data was not successfully implemented. As a result, the script focuses solely on data scraping, cleaning, and processing without any visualization.
